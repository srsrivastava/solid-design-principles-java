# SOLID Design Principles – Java

This repository contains practical, runnable Java examples demonstrating
the SOLID design principles.

Each principle includes:
- A **bad implementation** that violates the principle
- A **good implementation** that refactors the design correctly

The goal of this repository is to understand *why* each principle exists
and how it improves real-world code maintainability.
